What is Web?

What is the difference between Internet and Web?

Internet is the collection of hardware/computers....connected globally....through LAN or WAN

			interconnected computers globally - global network of hardware
			
WWW or web - collection of globally connected resources mostly web pages..(images)

Internet is providing the infrastructure and Web is the application -  actual content....HTML pages...

We email, file transfer....through Internet...WWW is one of the activities you can perform using Internet.

World Wide Web - when webpages(HTML) are interchanged between user and client


1. http/https : Protocol on which web works. If we transfer to some data across computers, they need to follow some protocol...(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
				(rules/contract)
2. how the resources would be identified : URL (unified resource locator)
3. the resources have some langugage : HTML

ports are hidden : when request reaches to an ip, server location, several apps are runnning on different ports...
microserver is divided virtually - webrequests are lsitended on port 80 ...database servers - 22 (SSH)

	lets say there is a webpage I want to expose on Internet : http://www.mywebsite.com/aboutme -->http://www.mywebsite.com:80/aboutme 
	(server - DNS resolves this into IP - server where this app is hosted - it will reach for root and then aboutme page in HTML is searched and then rendered)
	
https://www.facebook.com/ : hits the server where facebook application is hosted and homepage of facebook is returned.

The resources which are exchanged mostly are web pages or HTML. (Hyper Text Markup Language)

WWW or web - collection of globally connected resources mostly web pages in HTML..connected through hypertext...

HTML : there are links which connects pages on different servers. We click on one link, the request goes and some other page is rendered. This is hypertext
	   The hypertext is marked up with tags....so that client can understand the text...client is the browser...

	some http application should reside - listening on server, which should be able to host HTML pages (links)
	
	Client & Server
	Server - which can serve a request
	         for http request - http server or web server ( eg : Apache Tomcat, Websphere)
	Client : 
	
	gmail.com : SMTP server..(email - SMTP protocols)
	
CHrome is a web client : when we enter URL - we hit those http /web servers and  websites load...web pages get loaded
	
httpRequest
httpResponse

Autofilling the suggestion for tags....in IDE

quirks mode

HTML: structuring (style tags are deprecated now)
CSS(Cascaded Style Sheets): styling
JS(JavaScript) : behaviour 

quirks mode : apply legacy rules and display the page.

block level elements - a line break before and after them.
inline elements - 

CSS

table{} - referenecing the element
#tb1{} - referencing through the id
.tbclass - referencing through the class of the element


<div> - groups together block level elements
<span> - groups together inline elements

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactive web apps - data exchange through request parameters
Form : request parameters are sent using form element and the action mentioned is executed.

<form> tag - the need for form - in web, to exchange the data 

The action attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
The method attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).
-----------------------------------------------

<form> -- on submit, it creates an http request, with URL = action value, and request param = form param

HTTP Request types -
GET --- http://google.com/search?q=Virat&mode=online&rating=2&feedback=heeell - default request type


POST --- http://google.com/search : update on the server /backend

form-data
q=Vikas
mode=online
rating=2
feedback=s;fjks

PUT,DELETE etc
